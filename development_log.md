# Development Log

- Created `lib/core/app_theme.dart` to centralize the four fixed typography sizes (22, 18, 16, 12).
- Added `lib/core/responsive_wrapper.dart` to provide a constrained layout wrapper for every page body.
- Replaced all `responsiveVisibility` calls with constant values and removed their conditional statements to enforce the fixed layout.
- Normalized every explicit `fontSize:` value to one of the allowed sizes (22.0, 18.0, 16.0, 12.0).
- Wrapped every page `Scaffold` body with the new `ResponsiveWrapper` widget and imported it where required.
- Updated `main.dart` to consume the new `AppTheme`.
- Pending: run `flutter analyze` to surface any remaining static analysis errors.
- Attempted to run `dart format lib` but the `dart` CLI is not available in the execution environment (`bash: command not found: dart`).
- Attempted to run `flutter analyze` as requested but the Flutter SDK is not available in the environment (`bash: command not found: flutter`).
