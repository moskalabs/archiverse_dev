# Development Log

## 2025-09-25
- Created fixed layout helpers (`lib/core/app_theme.dart`, `lib/core/responsive_wrapper.dart`).
- Updated `responsiveVisibility` to always return `true` to remove breakpoint-based conditions.
- Quantized typography to allowed font sizes (22, 18, 16, 12) by updating `flutter_flow_theme.dart`.
- Wrapped the entire app with `ResponsiveWrapper` in `main.dart` to ensure fixed-width layout.
- Attempted to run `dart format` but the command is unavailable in the container environment.
- Tried to execute `flutter analyze`, but Flutter is not installed in the current container.

## 2025-09-26
- Updated layout wrapper usage so that fixed-width constraints apply only on the web build (`main.dart`).
- Restored breakpoint-based `responsiveVisibility` behavior on mobile while keeping all widgets visible on web (`flutter_flow_util.dart`).
- Adjusted typography helpers to clamp font sizes on web but preserve original dynamic sizing on mobile (`flutter_flow_theme.dart`).
- Confirmed Flutter tooling is still unavailable when attempting to run `flutter analyze`.
