# Development Log

## 2025-09-25
- Created fixed layout helpers (`lib/core/app_theme.dart`, `lib/core/responsive_wrapper.dart`).
- Updated `responsiveVisibility` to always return `true` to remove breakpoint-based conditions.
- Quantized typography to allowed font sizes (22, 18, 16, 12) by updating `flutter_flow_theme.dart`.
- Wrapped the entire app with `ResponsiveWrapper` in `main.dart` to ensure fixed-width layout.
- Attempted to run `dart format` but the command is unavailable in the container environment.
- Tried to execute `flutter analyze`, but Flutter is not installed in the current container.
